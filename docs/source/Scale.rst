Rules of Scale
==============

The brain operates in a complex, high dimensional space. What is the correct scale to make observations about the brain and behavior? If the brain is a symphony, and the neurons are individual instruments. All this talk about “dimensionality” can be confusing: after all, we work in three dimensions, and it is difficult for us to visualize more than three or four. For high dimensional spaces, it is sometimes easier to think in terms of analogy, or by a description of how all the interrelated parts talk to one another. When listening to a symphony, how do you decide what part of the music matters? A symphony is composed of tens of individual instruments that all come together to create a cohesive sound through the dynamic ways in which they interact with one another. Listening to one instrument gives you critical details about the time signature, the key, and the melody of the music. Listening to two instruments together: say, the exchange between strings and woodwinds, gives you a picture of how these two sections play off one another. This is akin to the different scales of inquiry in neuroscience. Investigators can ask questions about individual neurons (instruments), populations of neurons (sections), or the entire brain (the orchestra).

   Notice how, in the video, it is possible to predict in broad terms patterns in
   the other instruments from observing patterns in the soprano section alone. This 
   is similar to how neuroscientists predict complex behaviors by reducing many dimensions,
   or channels, into one channel. Ask yourself: do we lose information by doing this?

Herein lies the central paradox of modern neuroscience. It seems like the computations that the brain performs about internal states are distributed, or spread out across a very wide region of the brain, and at the same time, intricate, or occurring in a very specific order according to a very specific set of computational rules (Betzel & Bassett, 2017). This means that it can be difficult to understand what is actually going on. It would be like trying to understand a conversation about a difficult breakup by standing next to one speaker on a busy conference call. We would only receive one or two words, enough to know that there is a complex emotional exchange proceeding, but not enough to understand who is performing what roles. If you’ve ever stood next to someone on the phone, you know how frustrating it can be to intuit what is going on from looking at one part of the exchange instead of the exchange in its entirety. 

In the last few decades, affective, or emotional neuroscience has become less taboo, as there is increasing consensus that internal states are just as biologically real as any movement or sensation. The question of what these internal states look like is exciting, interesting, and a huge part of understanding what it feels like to be in different kinds of minds. However, much like listening to the musical piece above, it's not a trivial task figuring out how a cohesive song comes together from one or two pieces alone.
