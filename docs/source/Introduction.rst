What is disease?
=====
The language and practice of psychiatry treat mental illness as static and categorical, but the truth is much more beautiful, and much more strange. Diseases in the DSM-5 as we know them are not biologically real. There is no one presentation of depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder, and indeed these definitions have changed over time depending on the dominant values of the culture defining the pathology (Canino & Alegría, 2008).

The 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) has done an exceptional job of determining which clusters of symptoms tend to co-occur. Beyond this, it has provided clinicians with a differential diagnosis - a checklist to follow to determine, through process of elimination, which particular symptom cluster a patient is suffering from. Let’s step back and examine the scientific consensus:

.. code-block:: console

   There tend to be stable, consistent clusters of 
   co-occurring behaviors and feelings

   We believe these clusters are specific enough to be 
   different, because doctors can determine which one of 
   these clusters a patient belongs to 

   We believe these clusters are real, because doctors 
   tend to agree with one another about who belongs in what 
   cluster with a high degree of reliability


Many of the clusters overlap with one another. This tells us we might be missing something important. This could be:

.. code-block:: console

   Shared processes that form the basis of several diseases, 
   like adding a layer of primer to a painting (Eysenck & Fajkowska, 2017).

   Delicate subcategories of behaviors or internal 
   states that might not be captured by questionnaires.

   Internal states with differences subtle enough to fall 
   into the same category

Mental illness is experienced personally. It is experienced as a series of internal states. The chain of events that leads to those states, whether experienced consciously or not, occurs at the scale and in the language of the brain’s computations, not at the level of its behavior. Two individuals with different motivations, ideas about the self, ideas about the world, and subtle internal feeling states might display the same behavior, because there are less behaviors available to display than there are internal states to motivate that behavior. The central techniques neuroscience and psychology: anchoring the result of a complex and poorly understood internal, emotional process to a well understood, easily identifiable external one, are sufficient to describe clusters of co-occurring behaviors, but lack the specificity to treat them, because to change or treat a disease process means to interface with it at the same scale as its cause and effect chain, rather than at its endpoints.

Ask any social worker and they will tell you this is not new information. Many of you, especially those with experience in the biopsychosocial model, understand intuitively that while a DSM-5 label may be a helpful starting place, the real work of a counsellor begins by understanding the complex chains of cause and effect in client’s social and emotional world that explain why they behave in certain ways. This is chiefly the role of network neuroscience, just at a different scale. Social work occurs at the interpersonal scale, neuroscience occurs at the scale of the brain and its activity. The cause and effect chains of the social world impact the cause and effect chains within the brain, and vice versa. This is why any understanding of mental health must be situated, comprehensive, and encompassing multiple scales. 

In the 12 years following the publication of the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), discoveries in systems neuroscience, computational
neuroscience, biology, and psychology have provided us better scientific frameworks for understanding what goes wrong at the computational level of the brain when someone is trapped in a cycle of distress and counterproductive behavior. 

As future clinicians, you have the opportunity to align medical, legal, and therapeutic frameworks for diagnosing and treating mental illness to this new scientific understanding. These entrenched structures are slow to change, but change and its inevitability form the basis of much of this new science of cognition. The goal of this page is to provide context about how information processing in the brain actually occurs, in order to determine what the DSM-5 is useful in telling us, and what is not.
